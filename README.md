If we tap on run, we're going to get a prompt in our console that asks for our name.

Here, I'm going to enter Federico because that is my name.

And it's going to say, Welcome to Hangman Federico.

Now we have a word to guess, and we can guess by entering a letter.

I'm going to put B, And since that was wrong, it's going to say we have two tries remaining, then

I'm going to try s and it's going to place it there.

If there is an S, of course, if there is no S, it's going to say we have another wrong guess.

So we can say, for example, Z, it's going to say sorry, that was wrong.

One try remaining.

Now if we type in something such as E and we put C and maybe even an R, and we slowly start to guess

the word, you'll see it's going to slowly fill out.

Now it's only missing one letter, so we'll add T and the word was secret.

So it's a very simple version of hangman.
